abstract ={Prior analyses of prices of the NYSE and other exchanges find that transitory price volatility is greater at the open of trading than at the close. We extend this line of research by using 40
years of hourly Dow Jones 65 Composite price index data to estimate transitory volatility throughout the trading day. Our results indicate that transitory volatility steadily declines during the trading
day. We find a similar intraday decline in transitory volatility for a $2{\textstyle{1 \over 2}}$-year sample of the individual firms in the Dow Jones 30 Industrials Index. The results are consistent with
the hypothesis that trading aids price formation and do not support the argument that particular trading mechanisms are the source of greater volatility at the open of trading.},

doi = {10.1093/rof/rfm023},
abstract ={The tendency to introduce anonymity into financial markets apparently runs counter to the theory supporting transparency. This paper studies the impact of pre-trade transparency on liquidity in
a market where risk-averse traders accommodate the liquidity demand of noise traders. When some risk-averse investors become informed, an adverse selection problem ensues for the others, making them
reluctant to supply liquidity. Hence the disclosure of traders' identities improves liquidity by mitigating adverse selection. However, informed investors are effective liquidity suppliers, as their
adverse selection and inventory costs are minimized. With endogenous information acquisition, transparency reduces the number of informed investors, thus decreasing liquidity. The type of information that
traders hold and the effectiveness of insider trading regulation are crucial to distinguish between equilibria.},
